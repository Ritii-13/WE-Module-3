## Gen-AI Assignment WE Module-3

This repository contains the coursework and code for the Generative AI classes taken as part of Module 3 in the Women Engineers program offered by Talentsprint and supported by Google.

## Work Done:
Most of the work has been done by making use of and havinf conversations with ChatGPT 3.5.
- Solved one of the computational thinking questions using GenAI: 
    - Problem of Idli Distribution (also commonly known as Fair Distribution Problem)
    - The conversation highlights AI's ability to understand the problem and provide a straight forward solution but fails in coming up with a different approach that would be computationally harder to come up with for a human. We also understand that the AI is not learning anything but simply trying to provide contextually relevant answers and please the user.

- Understood and played the game of Yatzee with a GenAI
    - The conversation highlights AI's ability to explain a game and its rules clearly, granted it had to be prompted often to achieve the result. AI is also unable to play the game as it lacks the ability to remember the state of the game and make decisions based on that. It also lacks the ability to understand the context of the game and make decisions based on that.
    - It was able to provide a psuedo code for the game broken down appropriately into functions and steps.

- Wrote the code and implemented a testing strategy for the Yahtzee code using GenAI
    - The conversation highlights AI's ability to provide large number of testcases but we also find sometimes the testcases to be inaccurate. It had to be prompted to not just provide testcases but follow the approach of unit testing.

- Implemented a Markov chain model for text generation
    - The conversation highlights AI's ability to understand the concept of Markov chain and provide a simple implementation of the same. It also highlights the AI's ability to understand the concept of probability and randomness and use it to generate text.
    - At the same time we also acknowledge its inability to provide a good and correct code right away.
    - We also prompted it to include testing in the code for text generation using Markov chain.

## Conclusion:
Our jobs are safe for now.
